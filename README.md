# Vik's and Pillage 

## What is it about ❓

This is a full front-end **React web-applications** created during an Hackathon in collaboration with [Maxime Quesnel](https://github.com/Maxime-Quesnel), [Mustafa Topal](https://github.com/MustafaTopal28) and myself.

The main theme of this Hackathon was to create an application for people from another time, we decided to create an interactive map made for war planifications during the vikings period. The Hackathon lasted for only 24 hours and we had only few months of knowledge of React back then. But still we were able to win this Hackathon with this project.

This is a really important milestone for myself as it is there that i discovered how to use mapbox for the first time.

I will try to maintain the project from time to time and make it a little bit better with my new knowledge.

## What's being used ⚙️

Here are the few libraries used in this project:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
